Hi!

I need a regular expression.

It has to split a string into two parts. These parts are always separated by a dot if both are represented. The first part of the string can be a phone number or email address. The second part (after the dot) is an integer number. Sometimes a string can consist of only the first part - then there is no dot and no number.

Here are examples of strings:

```
+79216454341
+79216454341.1
+79216454341.12
+79216454341.132
+79216454341.7
evan.roda@gmail.com
evan.roda@gmail.com.1
evan.roda@gmail.com.12
evan.roda@gmail.com.123
```

A regular expression that can work for this case is `^([^\.]*)(\.\d*)?$`. This regex captures the phone number or email as the first part and the integer number as the second part, if they exist.

Here's what it does:

- `^` matches the start of the string.
- `([^\.]*)` captures a group that consists of any characters other than a dot `(.)`, 0 or more times. This is the first part of the string.
- `(\.\d*)?` captures a group that begins with a dot and then contains any number of digits. The `?` at the end means this part is optional, as it may or may not be present.
- `$` matches the end of the string.

Please note that this regex will only capture the two parts of the string if you are looking to extract them. If you are just looking to validate the format, you can use it as is. However, if you need to work with the parts separately, you can use this regex to match the string and then access the matched groups.

Here is how you can use it in Python:

```python
import re

s = '+79216454341.12'
match = re.match(r'^([^\.]*)(\.\d*)?$', s)

if match:
    print(f'First part: {match.group(1)}')
    print(f'Second part: {match.group(2)}' if match.group(2) else 'No second part')
```

This script will print the two parts of the string separately. If the second part doesn't exist, it will print 'No second part'. Note that the second part will include the dot as well. If you want to remove the dot, you can do so by accessing `match.group(2)[1:]`, but make sure to check if `match.group(2)` is `not None` first to avoid a `TypeError`.

Your code does not work with emails in the first part. This is because emails can have a dot in their composition, but you excluded it for the left-hand side of the expression.

---

**ChatGPT**:

You're absolutely correct, I apologize for the oversight. Emails can indeed contain dots, which my previous regular expression did not take into account.

Here's an improved version of the regular expression:

```python
import re

s = 'evan.roda@gmail.com.12'
match = re.match(r'^(.*)(\.\d+)?$', s)

if match:
    print(f'First part: {match.group(1)}')
    print(f'Second part: {match.group(2)[1:]}' if match.group(2) else 'No second part')
```

This time `(.*)` is used instead of `([^\.]*)`, which means that any characters, including dots, will be included in the first part. `(\.\d+)?$` is still used for the optional second part after the last dot, which is a sequence of digits.

Please note that this version will only work as expected if the integer part does not contain any dots, and the dot that separates the first and second parts is the last dot in the string.

The changes in this regular expression ensure that the first part captures everything up until the last dot (if it exists), while the second part captures an optional series of digits that come after the last dot.

**Artem**:

Now all dots belong to the first part of the string. Your regular expression grabs them too greedily. Maybe add a "?" character somewhere could helps?

---

**ChatGPT**:

I apologize for the confusion. You're absolutely correct in your observation about the greedy nature of the `.*` in my previous solution. To ensure that we match as few characters as possible before the `.`, we should use `.*?` instead of `.*`.

The `.*?` is a non-greedy version of `.*` and it will match as few characters as possible before allowing the rest of the regular expression to match.

Please see the corrected version below:

```python
import re

s = 'evan.roda@gmail.com.12'
match = re.match(r'^(.*?)(\.\d+)?$', s)

if match:
    print(f'First part: {match.group(1)}')
    print(f'Second part: {match.group(2)[1:]}' if match.group(2) else 'No second part')
```

In this regex, the `.*?` will match as few characters as possible, effectively capturing everything up until the last `.` (if it exists). The `\.\d+)?` will capture the optional second part of the string that starts with a `.` and followed by one or more digits. Please note that if the second part exists, the `.` will be included. To exclude it, you can use `match.group(2)[1:]` as shown in the Python code.

**Artem**:

Great, but I need one last little modification. The separating point is included in the second half of the expression, and I would like to exclude it from the match.

---

**ChatGPT**:

I understand. We need to modify the regular expression slightly to exclude the dot from the second match group. Here's the updated version:

```python
import re

s = 'evan.roda@gmail.com.12'
match = re.match(r'^(.*?)(?:\.(\d+))?$', s)

if match:
    print(f'First part: {match.group(1)}')
    print(f'Second part: {match.group(2)}' if match.group(2) else 'No second part')
```

In the new regular expression, `(?:\.(\d+))?` is used to represent the second part. Here, `(?:...)` is a non-capturing group, which means it groups the enclosed regex but doesn't capture it as a separate group. Inside this non-capturing group, `\.(\d+)` captures one or more digits after a dot.

This way, the second group in the match will only include the integer number and exclude the dot.
